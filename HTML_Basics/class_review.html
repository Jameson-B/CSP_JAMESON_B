                    Hardware is the physical components of the computer. <br>
                    Software is the instructions that the computer runs on. <br>

                    Lossy compression is when some of the data is lost in compression. <br>
                    Suitable for images, audio. <br>
                    Lossless compression is when none of the data is lost, and can be completely reconstructed. <br>
                    Suitable for text documents, programs. <br>

                A variable is a place where data is stored. <br>
                A variable declaration is the assigning of a value to a variable, using (in Python) the assignment operator =. <br>
                Some common data types include: integer, float, string, and Boolean. <br>
                An integer is a whole number, including negatives, positives, and zero. <br>
                A float is a number containing decimals. <br>
                A string is a sequence of characters. <br>
                A Boolean, first conceptualized by English mathemtician George Boole, has the value of <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. <br>

                An expression is a statement of operators and operands. <br>
                An operator is what performs an action on the data. <br>
                An operand is the data that is being acted on. <br>
                The basic arithmetic operators are (in Python): addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, exponentiation **, floor division //, and modulus %.

                A string is a sequence of characters. <br>
                Similar to arithmetic operators for numbers, there are string operators for letters and words. <br>

            <dd>
                A function (also known as a procedure or a method) is a chunk of code that takes parameters, operates on them, and returns an output. <br>
                A function definition is the creation of a function. It consists of a keyword, such as <i>def</i> (in Python), the function name, the parameters, the content of the function, and a return statement (in some cases). <br>
                A function invocation (also known as "calling a function") is the usage of a function in a program. it consists of the function name and the number of required arguments. <br>
                A parameter is a value that is operated on in the function. A parameter is like a local variable within the function. <br>
                An argument is the data that is given to a parameter when a function is called within a program. <br>
                A return statement assigns the output of the function to the function invocation. Essentially, it tells the program what the answer to the function is. <br>
