            Uncle Iroh is the funny, unassuming uncle, sent to babysit Prince Zuko in the middle of a frigid nowhere. In contrast to Zuko's feriocious and childish displays of fire-bending power, Iroah merely sits back and drinks tea. It's not until the conclusion of Book 1 that Iroh's true character shines through. We see a wise and loving, though imperfect, uncle. This is just the tip of the Iroh iceberg (er...teabag?).
            Iroh is a hit from the start, but as the TV show progresses, we only love him more and more. We learn that he has a complicated past, that he loves Suko as his own, that he would sacrifice anything to save him. Besides being the perfect foil to Zuko's temper and providing comic relief at every stop, Iroh represents hope for humanity. He opposes the typical Fire Nation overlord, proving through word and deed that the best leaders rarely hold the most power; the best leaders stand for what is right.
