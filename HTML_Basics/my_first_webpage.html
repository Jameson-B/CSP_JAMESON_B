            Iroh

            Uncle Iroh is the funny, unassuming uncle, sent to babysit Prince Zuko in the middle of a frigid nowhere. In contrast to Zuko's feriocious and childish displays of fire-bending power, Iroah merely sits back and drinks tea. It's not until the conclusion of Book I that Iroh's true character shines through. We see a wise and loving, though imperfect, uncle. This is just the tip of the Iroh iceberg (er...teabag?).<br>
            Iroh is a hit from the start, but as the TV show progresses, we only love him more and more. We learn that he has a complicated past, that he loves Suko as his own, that he would sacrifice anything to save him. (Also, lightning?!) Besides being the perfect foil to Zuko's temper and providing comic relief at every stop, Iroh represents hope for humanity. He opposes the typica, power-hungry warlord, providing through word and deed that the best leaders rarely hold the most power; the best leaders stand for what is right. Iroh is proof that even from the heart of a jaded, old Fire Nation general, good shines within us all.

            Appa

        <h3>

            Appa is who we all aspire to be like someday. The ever companion of Aang, this flying bison (buffalo?) has the (literally) biggest heart of any wind-bending creature out there. Appa is tireless in transporting Aang and his friends across the map, day and night. He always steps in to save the day, using his awesome might and strength. The possible last of his kind, he and Aang share a special, unbreakable bond. You want miss this reliable fuzzy pal in the sky.<br>
            Even though he can't speak, Appa communicates wonders. From his growls and yawns, to his blank, lovable expression, Appa is not short on feelings. No wonder we feel such pain when Appa is capture by the sand-benders in Book II! (Just kidding guys, we all knew he was gonna be fine.) Appa demonstrates the power of stoic determination and innocent love and loyalty.
