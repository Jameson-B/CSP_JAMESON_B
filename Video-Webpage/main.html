                    The "Yoda death sound" was featured in the 2007 video game <span class = "italic">Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</span>, developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. The sound asset, orginally from the 2002 film <span class = "italic">Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</span>, produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by 20th Century Fox, was used during the battle scene between characters Master Yoda and Count Dooku as one of Yoda's battle cries. The sound effect was then repurposed for the 2007 video game. Since then, it has entered the Internet meme halls of fame, frequently featured in YouTube videos such as this one. The only thing more annoying than Yoda dying is the roar of a TIE fighter. Wait, what if Yoda died in a TIE fighter crash? Now <span id = "italic">that's</span> something we don't want to think about.
