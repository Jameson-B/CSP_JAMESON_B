                Founded in 1936 in the Wasatch Mountains, Brighton is the first ski area to come to Utah <a href = "https://www.skiutah.com/blog/authors/lexi/ski-utah-resort-histories-brighton/" target= "_blank">(source)</a>. Nestled deep in Big Cottonwood Canyon east of Salt Lake City and surrounded in snow, this long-time powder park set the precedent for ski areas in the region. Having evolved over the past 89 years of operation, the resort now features six lifts, four of which have high-speed capabilities. Snowboarders feel at home at Brighton, whose culture welcomes the snowboarding community alongside skiers. The resort's mix of terrain parks, tree runs, jumps, side-hits, and groomers provides for a customzied experience. As a beginner, take it slow and easy on the Explorer chair. As a pro, send it off the Majestic Park or weave through trees accessible by the Snake Creek Express. Brighton is fun time for all ages and skill levels.
